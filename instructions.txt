Getting into Practice: Input/Output
Exercice 1: Simulate the ls command:
We want to develop a Java program that simulates the “ls” command, which is used to list
information about the files and directories in a given directory.
The user enters the full path to the directory, and then the list of files and directories contained in
that directory is displayed. Display the type <DIR> for directories and <FILE> for files for each
directory and file, as well as the permitted access modes ‘r’ if readable, ‘w’ if writable, and ‘h’ if
it is a cache file.
Display example:
..\xampp\htdocs\tp1\index.php <FILE> rw-
..\xampp\htdocs\tp1\accueil.htm <FILE> rw-
..\xampp\htdocs\tp1\images < DIR > rw

Exercise 2: Objects Serialization in products.dat
The objective of this task is to use read and write files to save and re-read a collection of
product-type objects.
• Create a Product class with the attributes id, name, brand, price, description, and number
in stock. The product class must implement the Serializable interface.
• Create an IProduitMetier interface that will declare the methods for managing our
Product entities. This interface contains the following methods:
o public void add(): which allows you to add a product to the list.
o public List<Product> getAll(): which loads the list of products from a file and
returns them as a list.
o public Product findById(long id): returns a product by id.
o public void delete(long id): deletes a product by id.
o public void saveAll(): saves all products to the file.
• Create a MetierProduitImpl class that implements the IMetier interface. This class
contains an attribute that represents a list of products and an attribute that contains the file
name for saving the products.
• Write an Application class containing the main method that offers the user the following
menu in a while loop:
1. Display the list of products.
2. Search for a product by its ID.
3. Add a new product to the list.
4. Delete a product by ID.
5. Save the products: this option saves the list of products to a file named products.dat.
6. Exit this program.
Getting into Practice: Handling Exceptions
Exercise 1:
You will create a Calculator class with three methods that must handle common errors.
Tasks:
• Method divide(a, b):
o Must return the result of a / b.
o If b is zero, display: “Error: Division by zero not possible.”
• Method convertToNumber(text):
o Must convert a string to a number (e.g., “123” → 123).
o If the string is not a valid number (e.g., “abc”), display: “Error: ‘abc’ is not a valid
number”

• Calculate(operation, a, b) method:
o Accepts: +, -, *, /
o For any other operation, display: “Error: Operation ‘&’ not supported”

Exercise 2:
1. Write the TooFastException class inheriting from the Exception class. The
TooFastException class does not contain any attributes. The constructor takes an integer as
a parameter and calls the super-constructor with the message “This is an exception of type
TooFastException. Speed involved: ” + the integer.
2. Write the Vehicle class, which has no attributes. The Vehicle class offers an empty
constructor and contains a single testSpeed() method. The method testSpeed() takes an integer
as a parameter and returns nothing. If the integer is greater than 90, the method throws a
TropViteException.
3. Add a main to the Vehicle class. Create an object of type Vehicle and call the
testSpeed() method with two different values. Display the call stack of the exception.
